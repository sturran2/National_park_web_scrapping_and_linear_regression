# National_park_web_scrapping_and_linear_regression

This project is to assemble a database by scrapping a website for data. The database needed to analyze at least 1000 samples, and look at 10+ features. Then, linear regression needed to be performed on the data to optimize the model for best correlation. 

For this project, data was scrapped from hikingproject.com. This project looked at trails in National Parks to assess how different factors affected attendance on the trail. This would be useful for National Park staff so they can identify which trails will likely see high traffic so they can plan maintenance and security appropriately.
